# 🛒 E-Commerce Product Display

Welcome to the E-Commerce Product Display project! This project was created as a challenge for a job position and showcases the use of Vanilla JavaScript to dynamically render and filter products fetched from a public fake API. The goal was to implement the solution without using any frameworks, utilizing CustomElements for componentization.

## ✨ Features

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Pure JavaScript with no frameworks.
- **Custom Elements**: Component-based architecture using Web Components.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Products are fetched from a public API and displayed dynamically.
- **Category Filtering**: Easily navigate and filter products by categories.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout and styling.
